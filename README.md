Implementation of basic shell with the following list of commands. All commands work. All flags are to be passed to the calling command in the following format: (command) (flags) (parameters). Flags can be passed altogether or as several separate dashes, but must be before the parameters. All -n flags are to be immediately followed by a number contatenated like "-n10".
cat <br />
cd <br />
chmod <br />
cp <br />
grep <br />
head <br />
history <br />
less <br />
ls (only runs on current working directory, but all flags(lah) work) <br />
mkdir <br />
mv <br />
rm <br />
rmdir <br />
sort <br />
tail <br />
touch <br />
wc <br />
who <br />
 | <br />
 ">" <br />
 ">>" <br />
